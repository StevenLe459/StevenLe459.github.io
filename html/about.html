        <p>Hello y'all! My name is Steven Le. My fields of interest in computer science are computational
            neuroscience and game programming/design. I first became interested in computer science when
            I discovered how it could be applied to many of the world's greatest problems to create
            solutions. As a person who suffers from schizophrenia, this sparked a curiosity in me to see
            how computer science can be applied to the problem of mental illness and its stigma in society.
            That is where I found my interest in computational neuroscience and game programming.
            Computational neuroscience can potentially find better therapies or cures for mental illnesses
            by using computer algorithms to sift through large amounts of brain data to uncover differences
            in the brain that lead to disorder. Game programming can also be applied to the problem of 
            mental health by creating games that represent mental illnesses accurately and battle mental
            health stigma.</p>
        <p>In my free time, I like to knit, crochet, cook, and bake. I also have been known to sleep a lot, 
            procrastinate on my homework, and obsess over cute corgis.</p>
