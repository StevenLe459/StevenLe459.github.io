        <p><i>Barely Touching Reality</i> is a game that is based on my experiences with 
            schizophrenia. It deals with the very literal topic of living with severe mental illness
            and the stigma against those with mental illness. This game is not meant to be 
            light-hearted. If you already suffer from mental illnesses or are easily triggered, please be 
            aware that this game contains stark depictions of mental illness.</p>
        <p>The goal of this game is to offer non-sufferers some insight on what schizophrenia actually is 
            and the dark realities sufferers often face in light of their illness. Hopefully, this game will
            challenge the stigma society has against those with mental illness and dispel the myths 
            people hold on schizophrenia. For the truth is, most people with schizophrenia are not violent 
            and many people with schizophrenia can lead very successful lives with the right support and 
            treatment. This game, while dark, will not show depictions or mentions of the main 
            character harming others and will, by the true end, show that there is hope for those 
            with mental illness.</p>
        <p>This game though is not meant to give you, the player, one "best" 
            depiction of what schizophrenia is. With the very nature of mental illness, it is experienced 
            differently from person to person. This game is merely a depiction of my experiences with 
            schizophrenia.</p>
        <p>With all that said, thank you for playing this game.</p>
