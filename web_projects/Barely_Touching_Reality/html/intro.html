        <p>You stand in the rain while letting the raindrops fall down your cheeks. In the midst of the 
            thunder, you hear a voice. "You're a monster." the voice says. The voice, 
            <a href="memoryOne.html">reminiscent of what many people have thought of you</a>, cuts 
            through the soft pattering of the rain. You attempt to brush aside the voice, but it keeps on
            nagging you. "You're a monster, just like the one behind you." You turn around. Behind you,
            stands a shadow monster, a constant reminder of your <a href="memoryTwo.html">diagnosis</a>.
            You try to ignore both of them and concentrate on the sound of the rain. Maybe if you stay
            in the rain for a little while, the hallucinations will go away.</p>
        <p class="crossed-out">No. Let's go back to your room. It's dry there.</p>
