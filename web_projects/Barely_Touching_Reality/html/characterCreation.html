        <p>Great! Now let's take your character... <b>and destroy it.</b> For in this unforgiving and
            cruel world, you can't choose who you will be born as. If everyone could, this world
            would be perfect. But it isn't. There is imperfection in every human, including you, and it 
            will eventually lead to your downfall. There is no magic nor gimmicks to save you either.
            And don't get me started on being the "good guy". Not everybody can be the protagonist
            of the story. Some are sadly born into the world as villains.</p>
        <p>In this game, you will play as a villain. She didn't choose to become a villain.    
            Rather, she was deemed as one by society due to her defect. Nevertheless, she is the villain. 
            No amount of magic nor miracles can save her from her role either. What a pitiful life.</p>
        <p>Your character will be an average college student. But she is defected. She has schizophrenia. 
            And throughout the game, she will battle her schizophrenia. But can she fight it, 
            if her schizophrenia is the very thing that makes her a villain? Only you and I will know...</p>
        <a href="intro.html">So, shall we begin?</a>
