        <p>Schizophrenia is a chronic and severe mental disorder characterized by recurring psychosis,
            or detachment from reality. Schizophrenia also affects how one thinks, feels, and behave. 
            The symptoms of schizophrenia fall into three categories: positive, negative, and cognitive.</p>
        <p>Positive symptoms are symptoms that are associated with a psychotic episode. These include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Hallucinations</li>
            <li>Delusions</li>
            <li>Disordered thought and speech</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Negative symptoms are symptoms that are associated with deficit in thought, feeling, and 
            behavior. These include: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Poverty of speech</li>
            <li>Showing little emotions</li>
            <li>Lack of social interation</li>
            <li>Lack of self-care</li>
            <li>Lack of motivation and apathy</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Cognitive symptoms are symptoms associated with deficits in cognition. These include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Deficit in attention, memory, and reasoning</li>
            <li>Decreased social cognition</li>
            <li>Decreased level of semantic processing</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It should be of note that people with schizophrenia often do not display all these symptoms
            and that each person's experience with schizophrenia is different.</p>
