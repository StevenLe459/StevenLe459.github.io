        <p>The first time you realized that people thought of you as a monster, you were in math class
            focusing on a test. In the background, you heard the sound of children laughing.
            You tried to ignore it, but the eerie nature of the sound eventually broke your concentration.
            The calculations you were once doing in a breeze became a muddle in your brain. All your 
            thoughts could focus on was a feeling of impending doom. A thought gets implanted into your
            head. "They're coming for you. For you especially."</p>
        <p>After class, you immediately rushed to your friend's side. "They're coming for me!" you blurted
            out to her. "Wait, what?" she asked. "The laughing children. They're coming after me." Your 
            friend laughs nervously. "You're joking right?" she replied. Your face drops. Why doesn't 
            she believe you? Can't she hear the laughing children too? "Don't you hear the 
            laughing children too?" you ask. Your friend still laughs nervously. "No..." she replies. 
            You realize that only you can hear that eerie laughter. You decide to drop the subject.
            "Never mind. Let's go to lunch", you tell your friend. As you walk to lunch, you can't help
            but see that your friend avoids your gaze.</p>
        <p>Your friend barely talks to you after that incident.</p>
